Welcome to Team 16 
### Features
Implementing the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for American Sign Language (ASL) image classification.

Dataset: Sign Language MNIST.

The code are partially based on the ViT model on keras. ViT are proposed by Alexey Dosovitskiy et al. for image classification, which applies the Transformer architecture with self-attention to sequences of image patches, without using convolution layers.
